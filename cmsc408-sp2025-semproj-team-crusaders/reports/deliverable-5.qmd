<!--
GUIDANCE:
- DO NOT CHANGE the section labels or levels.  The autograder will be looking for these to match.
- The autograder WILL be looking for snippets of my text and taking off points if it finds anything that I provide, 
except for section labels and levels.
- Add your text to each section, then DELETE mine.  
- Use your own words, and NOT those of ChatGPT!
- THINK about what you put in each section.

(provide a 2-3 sentence summary of your project and the domain area. This is to help
the reader zero in on your topic and the problem domain.  You'll providing more
details below, so don't overdo it!)

# Design Video

(JUST LIKE DELIVERABLE 4, embed a 4-5 minute video presentation summarizing the database design solution, discussion of any design tradeoffs, and reflections on the overall process. In your report please include links to both your original pitch video and the video for this deliverable.  Please note in THIS SECOND video if you made any changes to the design as presented in your original video.)

# Problem Description

## Problem domain

provide summary of the problem domain, providing context, scope of the area. For example, one might talk about the building murals in Richmond, and provide a bit of history (or pictures), so that someone understands the problem domain.

## Need

provide a summary on why a database is needed, and what problem it might help solve. Why does this database need to be developed?

## Context, scope and perspective

Who is the DB for, or what perspective will the DB represent? In the domain of sports teams, is the database for the coach, team owner, player, or fan?

## User roles and use cases

Identify the different user roles that will interact with the database. Describe their needs and how they will use the database. How will the database be used? Who will be using it? How will they be using it? How will the database be connected to other things? 

## Security and Privacy

Effective database security ensures that sensitive data is protected from unauthorized access, corruption, or theft. Discuss the following key security and privacy concerns relevant to your database design.

*You should convert these questions in statements, OR delete them altogether with your answer.*

### Authentication and Access Control

What authentication mechanisms will be used to verify users (e.g., usernames and passwords, multi-factor authentication, OAuth, SSO)?

What access control strategies will be implemented to ensure that users only have the necessary permissions? Consider role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC).

How will the database handle session management, timeout policies, and failed login attempts?

### Data Protection and Encryption

What encryption methods will be used to secure data at rest and in transit? Consider AES encryption for storage and TLS/SSL for data transmission.

How will personally identifiable information (PII) and other sensitive data be handled securely?

Will the database implement hashing or salting techniques for passwords or other sensitive data?

How will backups be managed securely to prevent data loss and unauthorized access?

## Ethical and Professional Responsibilities

Discuss the ethical and professional considerations related to your database project. Consider the following questions and complete the sections below.  Your responses should provide a thoughtful and relevant discussion on the topics as they relate to your specific project.

### Data Ethics

Are there any ethical concerns related to the data being collected, stored, or analyzed? Could this data be misused?  

### Bias and Fairness

Does your database introduce or reinforce biases? How can your design minimize bias and promote fairness?

### Data Ownership and Consent

Who owns the data in your system? Are users aware of how their data will be used? Is explicit consent required?

### Accountability and Transparency

If something goes wrong with the database (e.g., data leaks, incorrect data handling), who is responsible? How can transparency be maintained?

### Legal and Compliance Issues

Are there any relevant laws, regulations, or industry standards that should be considered (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, FERPA)?


# Database Design

## Entity-relationship diagrams

Created using proper software tools and consistent notation. Note: your design should consist of at least *5 major entities*. Use Chen notation to show the high level entities and relationships, and Crows-Foot notation to show the attributes, primary and foreign keys.

I'm sure that there will be more than one way to design your database to meet the needs of the problem statement. I’m looking for a discussion of why you make the design choices that you did. Were there any tradeoffs? Did you have to sacrifice one thing for another?

Note that most design flexibility is around cardinality and participation.

## Relational schemas

Listing of relations, their attributes, types, domain, and constraints, identification of the primary key and foreign keys and other constraints.

   Students( <u>id</u>, first name, last name, email, github user id )

## Functional Dependencies and Normalization

A discussion of the functional dependencies in the proposed database schema, and a demonstration of the  normalization of the relations to BCNF/4NF. This might consist of a description, in a text format, of the process of decomposing the tables extracted from the ERD translation into relations satisfying BCNF/4NF. Note that your decomposition via BCNF/4NF must be lossless.

## Specific queries

Given the context, scope, and perspective, the team should pose 20 distinct questions that the database can help answer. These can be general queries of use to all the users, or specific queries for different users or user roles. These questions should be written in precise words AND using relational algebra. Leverage Quarto to write the formulas!  See: <https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html#equations>  

You should also refer to the *examples* folder in *Homework 3*.

Note: distinct queries are those that are entirely different. Counterexample: "Display a list of student last names in alphabetical order" is not distinct from "Display a list of student names and email addresses". However, "Display a list of student last names in alphabetical order" is distinct from "Who are the five students with the highest GPA?”

## Sample Data

Sample data for each relation your design documented above. I’m looking for 5-10 tuples in each relation, to clearly communicate the domains of each attribute. I suggest that you use chatgpt to help create the tables.  NOTE - results from chatgpt are formatted in markdown, so if you ask chatgpt to produce a table of values with specific columns, you can cut/paste this directly into quarto and get a pretty table!

### Student table

Below are sample xx data xx from the *student* table.

| ID | First Name | Last Name  | Email              | Github User ID |
|----|-----------|-----------|--------------------|---------------|
| 1  | Aisha     | Hassan    | ahassan@vcu.edu   | ahassan       |
| 2  | Kenji     | Takahashi | ktakahashi@vcu.edu | ktakahashi    |
| 3  | Leila     | Nguyen    | lnguyen@vcu.edu   | lnguyen       |
| 4  | Mateo     | Gomez     | mgomez@vcu.edu    | mgomez        |
| 5  | Fatima    | Khan      | fkhan@vcu.edu     | fkhan         |
| 6  | Omar      | El-Sayed  | oelsayed@vcu.edu  | oelsayed      |
| 7  | Sofia     | Petrov    | spetrov@vcu.edu   | spetrov       |
| 8  | Luca      | Rossi     | lrossi@vcu.edu    | lrossi        |


## Project Management

Draft Project schedule: Given that you need to submit a final project by April 29, and that this report is due March 2, what needs to happen between now and then to ensure that you get this whole thing done? I’m looking for a GANNT chart with tasks and milestones.  See: <https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/gantt.html>

# README

A quality README is an important part of EVERY project. Using the Quarto *include* command we're including a copy of your README in the project report so that a human can evaluate it.

Make sure that you edit the README so that it's explanatory!  Note that you don't need a readme within the *reports* folder for this assignment. We're only
focused on the root *README.md*.

[Here is some info](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-a-good-readme-file/) on how to write a good README!
